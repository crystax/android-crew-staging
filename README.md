Crystax NDK's Crew
================================


1. How to start
--------------------------------

``crew`` is intended to maintain NDK's toolchains, utilities and libraries.

Utilities are required to run ``crew`` itself. These includes ``ruby``,
``curl``, ``tar`` and assorted archivers.

Libraries are native libraries that are not integral part of the Crystax
NDK but instead can be easily installed or removed if
necessary. Examples of libraires are ``Boost``, ``libpng``,
``freetype``.

``crew`` is a part of the Crystax NDK installation. To begin with crew
just install Crystax NDK.


2. Commands
--------------------------------

All commands will return 0 code on successful completion, and non-zero
positive code in case of error.

In the examples below ``crew`` command is run from the top Crystax NDK
directory.


### version

Show crew's internal version.

Example:

    $ ./crew version
    1.0


### help [command]

Output short information about available commands.

Example:

    $ ./crew help
    Usage: crew [OPTIONS] COMMAND [parameters]

    where
    
    OPTIONS are:
      --backtrace, -b output backtrace with exception message;
                      debug option
    
    COMMAND is one of the following:
      version         output version information
      help            show this help message
      env             show crew's command working environment
      list [libs|utils]
                      list all available formulas for libraries or utilities;
                      whithout an argument list all formulas
      info name ...   show information about the specified formula(s)
      install name[:version][:crystax_version] ...
                      install the specified formula(s)
      remove name[:version|:all] ...
                      uninstall the specified formulas
      source name[:version][:crystax_version] ...
                      install source code for the specified formula(s)
      remove-source name[:version|:all] ...
                      uninstall the source code for the specified formulas
      update          update crew repository information
      upgrade         install most recent versions
      cleanup [-n]    uninstall old versions and clean cache


### list [libs|utils]

List all available formulas, their upstream versions, crystax versions,
status (installed or not), sources status (installed or not).

Aterisk (``*``) next to utility or library name means that respective
release was installed.

Number in braces along with crystax versions mean that there is more
recent (crystax) version of the package.

Word ``source`` to the right of a library data means that source code
for the release was installed.

If 'libs' or 'utils' argument was specified the command will output
information only about libraries or crew utilitites respectively.

Example:

    $ crew list
    Utilities:
     * curl        7.42.0  1
     * libarchive  3.1.2   1
     * ruby        2.2.2   1 (3)
     * xz          5.2.2   1
    Libraries:
     * icu       54.1    3 (4)
     * boost     1.58.0  1      source
     * boost     1.60.0  1 (2)  source
       sqlite    3.9.2   1


### info name ...

Show information about the specified formula(s), including type,
dependencies, which versions are present in the repository, and which
versions (if any) are installed.

If there is an utility and a library with the same name than the command
will output info about both.

Example:

    $ crew info curl boost
    curl: http://curl.haxx.se/
    type: utility
    releases:
      7.42.0 1  installed
    
    boost: http://www.boost.org
    type: library
    releases:
      1.57.0 1  installed
      1.58.0 1  installed
    dependencies:
      icu (*)
           

### install name[:version] ...

Install the specified formula(s) and all it's dependencies; if no
version was specified then the most recent version will be installed;
otherwise the specified version will be installed.

``install`` command works only with library formulas. You can not install utility.
But you can upgrade utility (see below ``upgrade`` command description).

You can install any number of avaliable versions of any library. For example,
you can install boost 1.57.0, 1.58.0 and 1.59.0 at the same time. But you can
have only one crystax_version of any library installed. That is if you have
boost 1.58.0:1 installed and then install boost 1.58.0:2 the later will replace
the former.

Example:
    
    $ crew install ruby
    error: ruby is not available

    $ crew install boost
    boost 1.59.0:1 will be installed
    downloading: .....
    unpacking: .....


### remove name[:version] ...

For every specified formula (and possibly version) the ``remove`` command
works as follows:

* if the specified formula is not installed then command will do nothing
  and return with error message;

* if there are installed formulas that depend on the specified formula
  and as a result of the command execution all releases of the formula
  will be removed then command will terminate with error message;

* if only formula name was specified then all installed versions will be
  removed;

* otherwise only the specified version will be removed.

Example:

    $ crew remove icu4c
    error: boost+icu4c depends on icu4c

    $ crew remove boost+icu4c
    uninstalling boost+icu4c-1.57.0 ...
    uninstalling boost+icu4c-1.58.0 ...
    uninstalling boost+icu4c-1.59.0 ...

    $ crew remove icu
    uninstalling icu-54.1 ...


### source name[:version] ...

Install the source code for the specified formula(s); if no ``version``
was specified then source code for the most recent version will be
installed; otherwise source code for the specified version will be
installed.

``source`` command works only with library formulas.

You can install sources code for any number of avaliable versions of any
library. For example, you can install source code for boost 1.57.0,
1.58.0 and 1.59.0 at the same time.

You can install source code without installing respective library or
vice versa.

You can not install source code for the library that differs from
installed binary package only in ``crystax_version``. That is if you
have boost 1.60.0:1 installed, then you can not install sources for
boost 1.60.0:2.

Source code will be installed in the same directory where the specified
library version was (would be) installed. For example, if you have boost
1.60.0:1 installed then source code for the library will be installed into the
``$NDK_ROOT/packages/boost/1.60.0/src`` directory.

Example:
    
    $ ./crew source ruby
    error: ruby is not available

    $ ./crew source boost
    source code for boost 1.60.0:1 will be installed
    downloading: .....
    unpacking: .....


### build name[:version] ...

Build the specified formula(s) from their installed sources code; if no
``version`` was specified then the most recent version will be used;
otherwise the specified version will be used.

``build`` command works only with library formulas.

The resulting packages will be copied into a package cache dir (default
depends on the host OS) and unpacked into NDK's ``packages`` directory
exactly as ``install`` command would do.

Example:

    $ ./crew build boost
    error: boost source is not installed
  
    $ ./crew build jpeg
    Buiding JPEG for architectures: ...


### remove-source name[:version] ...

For every specified formula (and possibly version) the ``remove-source`` command
will remove installed source code.

If source code for the specified formula is not installed then command
will do nothing and return with error message.

If only formula name was specified then command will remove all
installed source code for the specified formula.

Example:

    $ crew remove-source boost:1.57.0
    removing source code for boost-1.57.0 ...

    $ crew remove-source boost
    removing source code for boost-1.58.0 ...
    removing source code for boost-1.59.0 ...


### update

Update crew repository information; this command never installs any
formula, just updates information about available formulas.

Upon execution the command will show information about new versions of
the crew utilitites if any, about new formulas added to the Crystax NDK
repository, and about new versions of the releases in the existing
formulas if any.

Example:

    $ crew update
    Updated Crew from a813ec99 to 6d2d71e9.
    ==> Updated Utilities
    curl, p7zip, ruby
    ==> New Formulae
    jpeg
    ==> Updated Formulae
    boost
    ==> Deleted Formulae
    libold


### upgrade

For all installed formulas do the following:

* for single version HostBase derived formulas: if there is more recent release then install it;
  
* for multi version HostBase derived formulas: for every installed release
  if there is a release with more recent crystax_verison then install it;
  
* for single version TargetBase derived base packages:  if there is more recent release then install it;

* for multi version TargetBase derived base packages: for every installed release
  if there is a release with more recent crystax_verison then install it;

* for packages: for every installed release if there is a release with more recent crystax_verison then install it.


Example:

    $ crew upgrade
    Will install: boost:1.59.0:1, icu4c:55.1:1
    downloading http://localhost:9999/packages/boost/boost-1.59.0_1.7z
    checking integrity of the archive file boost-1.59.0_1.7z
    unpacking archive
    downloading http://localhost:9999/packages/icu4c/icu4c-55.1_1.7z
    checking integrity of the archive file icu4c-55.1_1.7z
    unpacking archive


### cleanup [-n]

This command does two things.

First, for every installed library it removes all but the most recent
version.  For example, if boost 1.57.0, 1.58.0, 1.59.0 are installed the
command removes versions 1.57.0 and 1.58.0.  Since at any given time one
and only one version of any crew utility can be installed the command
does nothing with installed crew utilities.

Second, it removes archives from the cache and leaves only ones for the
currently installed libraries nad crew utilities.

If -n option is specified then command just outputs information about
what it will do but otherwise does nothing.

Example:

    $ crew cleanup -n
    Would remove: icu 54.1
    Would remove: boost 1.56.0
    Would remove: boost 1.57.0

    $ crew cleanup
    Removing: icu 54.1
    Removing: boost 1.56.0
    Removing: boost 1.57.0
